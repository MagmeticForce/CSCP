            SETUP FOR MOVING COURSES:
            * keywords that it looks for in the strings:
              * if the prerequisite is: MTH, CSI, APM, EGR, STA, WRT, or BIO
              * else if the prerequisite is: Major standing
              * else if the prerequisite is: or
              * else if the prerequisite is: (
              * else if the prerequisite is: )


            CASE ANALYSIS:
            * Suppose [thing1 thing2 thing3] is the course list, where thing1 pre-reqs are: thing2 OR thing3.
              How would the courses be reorganized?
              * We note that the goal is to have either thing2 OR thing3 come before thing1.
              * First, thing2 finds itself inside of thing1's pre-req's
              * But when it finds itself, the new index doesn't immediately update to thing1's location. Instead, 
                it first checks for the "or" prerequisite. This check would be an "if" statement nested inside of
                the "if" statmeent that checks whether it found itself inside another course's prerequisites.
              * In this case, it DOES find the "or" prerequisite. So what happens now is that it looks for thing3, the
                other prerequisite, starting from thing1's index and ending at the start of the array.
              * In this case, it does not find thing3 before thing1. Therefore, it updates the new_index variable to
                thing1's index
              * Finally, the array is spliced once to remove thing2, then spliced again to insert thing2 behind thing1.

            CASE ANALYSIS: 
            * Suppose [thing1 thing2 thing3 thing4] is the course list, where thing1 pre-reqs are: thing2 OR thing3 AND thing4,
              where the student must complete either thing2, or both thing3 and thing4 befroe taking thing1.

            CASE ANALYSIS: 
            * Suppose [thing1 thing2 thing3 thing4 thing5 thing6 thing7] is the course list, where thing1 pre-reqs are: thing2 AND thing3
              AND either thing4, thing5, or thing6, AND thing7
            * This case empahszies the fact that it only checks whether the "or" pre-requisite comes directly after the course name.
            * It also brings up a situation where there is more than 1 "or"'s. This brings up the following fact. thing4 will not 
              find thing5 befroe thing1. But it doens't update to the new_index just yet. Instead, it checks if "or" comes after
              "thing5". In this case, it does, so then it repeats the process, except now with thing6.

            CASE ANALYSIS: 
            * Suppose [thing1 thing2 thing3 thing4 thing5 thing6 thing7] is the course list, where thing1 pre-reqs are:
              thing2 or thing3 AND thing4 or thing5 or thing6 AND thing7.


            CASE ANALYSIS: 
            * Suppose [thing1 thing2 thing3 thing4 thing5 thing6 thing7] is the course list, where thing3's
              pre-requisites are: 

            

            Conclusions from case-analyses:
            * Let CourseA be the course currently being looked at.
            * The program looks at every course behind it, and for each course it looks at, it sees if CourseA is inside of
              its prerequisites.
            * Suppose it runs into CourseB, which has CourseA in its prerequisites.
            * It first checks whether "or" comes directly after the CourseA prerequisite. 
            * If it does, it goes to the next prerequisite, which we'll call CourseC, then it tries finding CourseC, starting from
              CourseB and ending at the start of the array.
            * If it DOES find CourseC before CourseB, CourseA doesn't have to be moved, and it skips to two bullets below.
            * But if it DOESN'T find CourseC before CourseB, then it checks to see if "or" comes after CourseC, and if it does,
              it repeats the previous two bullets as well as this bullet.
            * If "or" does NOT come after CourseC, or if CourseC comes before CourseB, then it proceeds to do this process but backwards: 
              it checks whether "or" is BEHIND CourseA. If so, it goes to the course behind the "or" prereq and tries finding it before CourseB. 
              If it's found before CourseB, then it doesn't have to be moved and skips to the next bullet. But if it isn't foun before CourseB,
              then it see if "or" is behind CourseB and repeats the process.
            * If it couldn't find The new_index is updated, it moves itself
            * If a course had to be moved - which can be determined via the return variable - then the index being looked at gets scanned again, to
              ensure no items are skipped.
            * Lastly, it moves on to the course that comes after CourseA and repeats the whole 
              process.

Because there could be cases where the new course isn't one we scanned yet, and if we just move to the next index, we'll skip it!)


So then it  checks if all of the courses before Course 5
have Course 5 in their prereqs. It sees that Course 3 has Course 5,
but since "or" comes before it, it checks to see if Course 4
comes before Course 3, and finds that it does, so Course 5
doesn't have to be moved.

          Old notes:
            * Major standing is taken care of first - if 
              a course is being looked at and doesn't have 
              "major standing" in its string, and if a course 
              behind it DOES have "major standing" in its 
              string, then the new_index is the course with
              "major standing"
            * Then, it checks for other pre-requisites.
            * Some coruses are treated in a unique way due to their lengthy
              pre-requisite description
                * CHM 1440: if MTH 0662 exists, and this course is before it,
                  it will move behind it
                * PHY 1510: MTH 1554  
            * Inside of each "if" statement described above, it sets
              the return variable to true since it had to change the
              course ordering


            Regarding the pop-up if you drag-and-drop a course in an
            invalid spot causing it to reorganize the courses:
            "This migth be a bit different than how we originally imagined it,
            but I think this new thing will still work out. It makes it more
            unqiue from the other schedule planner."
